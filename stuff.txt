My stuff goes here.
 In follow-up to my phone message, the general go-live time frame is about eight weeks; most of that time is is 
   consumed in the security assessment but several other tasks are managed by several different teams.
   That said, a process to reduce the security scan by a couple weeks should be available in the near future.
